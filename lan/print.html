    <div class="left-content">

    <p>Whether your printing an assignment on time or in a hurry, going through a print checklist is essential to make sure mistakes are avoided to save you time and money!</p>

     <div class="sub-headings">1. Check your bleed</div>


    <p>So what is a bleed? A bleed is where your artwork extends to and this is important because when you print and trim yout document, it means that your artwork won’t be cut off  when trimmed. Generally, a 3mm bleed is fine but on larger documents this can be increased.</p>

    <div class="sub-headings">2. Ensure your document is set to CMYK</div>

    <p>This includes converting your images ot CMYK also. This will ensure your printed outcome matches the colours and design used in the document.</p>

    <div class="sub-headings">3. Embed your fonts & links</div>

    <p>If your does not have the same fonts as your document then a replacement font will be substituted. To avoid this you can embed your fonts into the PDF. Within Adobe Illustrater you can ‘create outlines’ of your text (after editing) to ensure your text prints as intended.</p>

    <div class="sub-headings">4. Proof reading</div>

    <p>To avoid pixelated and poor quality printed images, It is best to ensure your images are of at least 300 pixels per inch.</p>

    <div class="sub-headings">5. Image resolutions</div>

    <p>Within Adobe programs such as Photoshop, Ilustrator and InDesign, spell checking must be done manually unless you get someone to check your work for. It is essential to avoid unncessary costs.</p>

    <div class="sub-headings">6. Hard copy proofs</div>

    <p>Spending those few extra dollars of hard copy proofs is the best way to assess the future printed outcomes colours, text size and layout.</p>

    <div class="sub-headings">7.  Plan ahead</div>

    <p>If your project is complex then it is best to consult with your chosen printing place prior to the deadline. Some places do same day printing but others do not and it also depends on how busy the place is. Best bet is to contact them early to ensure your project can be printed on time.</p>

    <div class="sub-headings">8. Crop Marks </div>

    <p>If you need to trim your document down, save the document with crop marks.</p>
